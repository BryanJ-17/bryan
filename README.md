# Hi, this is Bryan
Welcome to my assignment on types of web browsers and their main features
I decided to differentiate web browsers based on their popularity and general use. Google chrome, Mozilla firefox, Microsoft edge and Safari for their mainstream appeal and being preferred for general use by internet users across the world. Google chrome itself accounts for about 77% of all web browser users in the world.
This is contrasted with niche web browsers like Brave, Coowon, Epic and OperaGX that serve a smaller portion of the worldwide users and while they have all the general features of a web browser, they are packed with specialized features to distinguish them and attract a particular audience.

    <P1> These application softwares help users link to information stored in web servers and web-based applications. </P1>
    
    <H2> Niche web browsers include applications like OperaGX, Coowon, Brave and Epic. 
        
        <div> <img src="opera gx logo.png" </div> <div> <img src="coowon logo.jpeg" </div>
        
        <div> <img src="brave logo.png" </div>    <div> <img src="epic logo.jpeg" </div> 
    
    </H2>
    
    <P2> These niche browsers have the ordinary functions of a web browser but are also have specific target audiences like 
         OperaGX and Coowon which are focused on gamer needs while Brave and Epic are focused on user privacy and security. </P2>
